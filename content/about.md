summary: Who Am I?

I'm Morgan Kenyon. This blog is a place for me to share my thoughts on Jesus and the modern life.

I'm not a scholar, my degree is in computer science and I've been a programmer for the last 7 years. So there's no expecatation that this content is free from errors. So if you find ideas or concepts you disagree with in my writing, I'd be surprised if you didn't.

If you want to reach out to me, you can reach me at deepcreekspace at gmail dot com.
