summary: Would you rather the Bible be in the Trinity? Instead of the Holy Spirit? Why is the Bible more comfortable to us?
---

If God gave you the opportunity to determine the trinity, what 3 objects would you pick?

Would you substitute the Holy Spirit for the Bible? So Father, Son and the Bible?

Before you get all mad about it about my heretical suggestion. Which of these 4 are the most comfortable to you?

Which are you more likely to talk to people about? The Spirit? Or the Bible?

I think for most of us, our primary goal is to know the bible. As someone who grew up in American Christianity, I think that gets more of an emphasis then the Spirit. (At least in my experience)

But should that be the case? What does our obsession and elevation of the bible reveal about us and our priorities?

## Why?

I think this comes from conviction in my life. At times, when someone asks me "what's the Spirit teaching you?" I'll be like "I don't know. It's hard to know what he's saying".

But if someone asks me what I've been reading in the Bible, I have a better answer.

To me, the Bible is approachable, understandable, I can read it and think whatever I want about it.

But the Spirit is more opaque, takes time to cultivate a relationship, not really a "how to manual" approach like we have in Scripture.

I'm not alone in that. It's easier to prescribe reading your bible than build a relationship with the Holy Spirit.

## What I'm Not Saying

With these questions, I'm not saying the following:

* The Bible isn't important - it obviously is
* The Bible isn't God breathed - it obviously is
* The Bible doesn't contain God's truth - it obviously does
* We're better off without the Bible - we obviously are better off with it

If you read this article and that's what you hear me say, that's you. That's not what I'm saying.

## What I Am Asking

What I am asking.

* Do we function as if the Bible is more important to our faith than the Spirit?
* Do we forget that the Trinity models relationship for us?
* Does our faith turn into a solitary pursuit of knowledge that I can do by myself?
* Do we stop at the Bible, rather than seeing how it leads us to the Trinity? 
* Is our obsession with the Bible unhealthy?

## This Isn't New

When Jesus interacted with the religious elite of the day, what was one of the main things he argued against?

The adherence to rules versus seeing what brought life to people. Jesus was fine breaking the "rules" because he was more interested in people. He reprioritized mercy over rules.

The religious read a list of rules and applied the rules, but Jesus was like "look beyond the rules man".

> There's obviously more to scripture than just "rules", but we tend to have an unique fascination towards "rules". Much like the Jews of Jesus's time.

Is it any surprise that we're dealing with the same things today? This isn't a new temptation.

## New Testament Churches

As you read through scripture, at times Paul founds a church, sticks around for a couple weeks, then gets driven out of town.

I'm like, "what the heck?" I've been in the church most of my life and feel unqualified to lead. But he's charging new converts to lead a church in the order of weeks.

I don't want to hold up the New Testament churches as models of morality. They had a lot of problems. But in Paul's letter, he seems to suggest that the Spirit will guide them in what they need to know.

I think today we'd much more prescribe "read your bible" instead of "listen to the Spirit". Because who is "qualified" to lead our churches today? People who have advanced degrees in Bible. The emphasis is Bible.

## Wrapping Up

As humans, there are things we more naturally gravitate towards certain things. I believe the tempation of the Bible draws us away from the Spirit. We find comfort in a book more than we do a relationship. But it shouldn't be that way.
