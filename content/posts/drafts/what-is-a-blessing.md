> He who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the Lord ~ Proverbs 18:22

> Behold, children are a heritage from the Lord, the fruit of the womb a reward. Like arrows in the hand of a warrior are the children of one's youth. Blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them! ~ Psalm 127:3-5

What is a blessing?

If you consult a dictionary, it could be:

* God's favor and protection
* a beneficial thing for which one is grateful; something that brings well-being

In the past 7 years, I've gotten married and had 3 kids. All things that scripture attests and being good things and a blessing.

In that same timespan, I like myself less than I did 7 years ago.

7 years ago Morgan was generally happy, hopeful and enjoyed life more than today's Morgan.

It's hard for me to know what to do with that.

## Old Friends

This past weekend, I reluctantly attended a funeral of an college friend.

Seeing my former friends brought back memories of college. In college I was:

* socially active
* making progress in my studies
* looking forward towards starting a career
* dating a wonderful girl

Looking back, I long for some of those same feelings. Specifically around being social with people.
