Who/What is Israel?

When you read through scripture, you'll hear the word Israel a bunch. And while it's not often talked about, it has a bunch of different meanings.

Lets dive in.

## One Guy

The name originates with Jacob. Son of Isaac, grandson of Abraham. 

In Genesis 32, Jacob wrestles with a man. Jacob demands a blessing of him, and the man responds with:

> "Your name will no longer be Jacob," he said. "It will be Israel because you have struggled with God and with men and have prevailed" ~ Genesis 32

## A Family

Then as the story progresses, Israel becomes the name associated with Jacob's family.

They move down to Egypt as 72 people.

Then are miraculously rescued out of Egypt as the mix multitude.

## A Loose Coalition

## A Nation State

## A Remnant

## The People Who Follow Christ

## A Modern Nation State

This one is pretty different. The only non Biblical definition of the term.

## Why Is This Important?

It's important, because whenever you hear the word "Israel", there are a variety of interpretations.

Since there are options, that means you could possibly get it wrong.

You might believe, "well of course they mean _this_ Israel", because sometimes that isn't very apparent.

I think as the Bible progresses, you see the term consistently redefined. Its meaning changes.

I think you need very clear evidence to pick a earlier definition over a later definition.

From a biblical perspective, the last definition of Israel is the people who follow and believe in Christ.

When we encounter that term, I think that is what our default definition should be. Unless there's clear evidence that they're talking about another Israel.
