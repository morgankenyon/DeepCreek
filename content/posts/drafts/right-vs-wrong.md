I hold very tightly to my beliefs.

I'm a resonably intelligent man, I'm educated, I've read some books. There are viewpoints and opinions of scripture that I strongly believe in.

And feel like some people are completely wrong about how they view scripture. It's very apparent to me that I'm right and they're wrong.

And this wrong v. right mindset colors how I approach scripture and community. And that's not by accident. I believe it's how American Christianity trains us to view the world. And we are worse off for it.

## Jesus' Open Invitation

Jesus didn't attach many qualifications for following him. He just asked people too.

And his disciples regularly demonstrated how much of Jesus' mission they didn't understand. They were pretty dense people.

Yet they ended up transforming the world after Jesus left.
