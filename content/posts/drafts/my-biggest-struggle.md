My biggest struggle is myself.

Some days I love myself, some days I hate myself.

Some days I'm glad to be a parent, other days I wish my kids would go away.

Some days I love being married, some days I'm super pissed off at my wife.

It's hard to get over myself. It's hard to be confident in my skills. Hard to know how to interact around my family.

## Confidence Killers

On some days, my kids, my wife and my home life are confidence killers.

There's part of me that wants to show up and be a great husband and dad. Then life happens.

The Bible says kids are a blessing. I know the verse, I've read the verse, yet I struggle to see that in my life.

I find it easier to be annoyed and frustrated at my kids.

Why doesn't God help change that? Why isn't he fighting more for that blessing in my life? Why am I so broken that I can't enjoy that?

## I'm Upset

The last couple days haven't been great for my wife, kids or job. So some of this is frustration talking.

But still, that frustration doesn't come from nowhere.

These are legitimate struggles I deal with on a daily basis. I don't like it.

I don't like hating my wife, I don't like hating my kids. I feel like a failure.

Why would God want that to happen? Why is he okay with that? Why doesn't he help me feel differently?

## I Don't Have Any Answers

I don't have any answers. I'm looking for consistencies. I'm looking for assurances. But it's hard to see God moving in my life.

It seems like I'm doing stuff by myself. I don't know where the disconnect is.

I'm confused. I hope God is listening and can help me out.
