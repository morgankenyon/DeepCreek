One of my biggest struggles is choosing to be grateful.

I have opinions, thoughts, expectations, and they're important to me. That impacts my relationships with my wife, kids and friends.

It's a part of me I wish were different, but I haven't really found out to change that.

## Down for Anything

I envy people and friends that are down for anything. They're flexible, they'll find a way to enjoy themselves.

That personality is super attractive. I enjoy being around those types of people.

I wish I were that person. I wish I could roll with the punches.
