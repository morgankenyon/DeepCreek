Who is Jesus to you?

If you ask different people, you’ll probably get a range of answers.

That’s also what we see in scripture. To some he was life, sight, healing. To others he was a thorn, an annoyance, something to get rid of.

Jesus was a polarizing figure. He rarely seems to be the wallflower sort of guy. I doubt people said, “Oh, Jesus, I didn’t realize you were here”

But is that the Jesus I encounter?

Do I experience someone who’s just kind of there. Someone I can ignore if I feel it convenient to.

When I read scripture, I tend to get “intellectual” Jesus, or a “that’s a good reminder” Jesus.

Not a “away from me, for I am a sinful man” Jesus.

But that is the way we should respond to him.

That is a correct recognition of how broken we are, and how much we need the life that he offers us.

If we believe Jesus to be primarily intellectual, or primarily just a good reminder, we won’t become the type of people he wants us to be.

We won’t get to the point of worshiping him as he deserves. Or trusting him with our lives. We’ll miss out on the blessings that he has ready to pour over us.
