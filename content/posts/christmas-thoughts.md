I've had the joy of seeing all 3 of my kids being born.

There's lots of ways to describe that event.

One one hand, it's messy and gross. One human is literally coming out of another one. There's blood, bodily fluid, it's intense.

And it's also a hard process. My wife spends hours pushing and laboring for this baby to be born. She's exhausted at the end of that process. It's hard work.

Then it's also a joyful time. Getting to see your baby after 9 months of waiting, that's an unique experience.

When thinking about this season, we're celebrating the birth of Jesus. And there's so many reasons to be happy and joyful about that.

He's our savior, he gives us life, he allows us to be reconciled to God and to each other.

But one aspect of his birth we tend to overlook is God's commitment to partner with us in his redemption story.

## Commitment to Partnership

Thinking about the Messiah coming, God among us. I imagine Jesus could have come down from heaven as a 30 year old, led his ministry for 3 years, got crucified, resurrected and then ascended again.

I think that could be a legitimate option. But that's not what happened. Instead he became a baby. He goes through the messy, hard and joyful process of childbirth.

He chooses to become weak, helpless and vulnerable. As with all babies, his survival was dependent on his parents.

And he slowly and gradually matured into an adult, like everyone else.

At times I feel unprepared as a parent, am I emotionally damaging my kids? Imagine if I was trying to raise Jesus? How unqualified I would feel. 

But God was comfortable with humans raising Jesus.

## That Shouldn't Surprise Us

But this fact shouldn't surprise us.

Looking through the Bible, God almost always partners with humans to accomplish his works. 

Like almost to a fault. Time and time again he gives humans opportunities, and they continue to find ways to mess it up.

God doesn't shy away from our humanness, he embraces it.

He honors us by becoming one of us. We become the temples where his Spirit resides. We are his priests on the earth, bringing his redemption to people.

I don't think that influences my belief and thinking enough. God isn't looking to cut us down, or push us out of the way so he can "get to work". We're an integral part of his plan.

That should help me feel immense value and privilege in my actions and choices. 

So as we approach Christmas, we celebrate his coming, we celebrate the new life he gives, and we celebrate the fact that he calls us to partner with him.
