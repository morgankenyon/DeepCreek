Have you ever witnessed a birth? I've had the joy of seeing all 3 of my kids being born.

There's lots of ways to describe that event.

One one hand, it's messy and a bit gross. One human is literally coming out of another one. There's blood, bodily fluid, it's intense.

And it's also a hard process. My wife has spent hours pushing and laboring for this baby to be born. She's exhausted at the end of that process. It's hard work.

Then it's also a joyful time. Getting to see your baby after 9 months of waiting, that's an unique experience.

When thinking about this season, we're celebrating the birth of Jesus. And there's so many reasons to be happy and joyful about that.

He's our savior, he gives us life, he allows us to be reconcilled to each other.

But I think one overlooked aspect of his birth, is God's and Jesus's commitment to partner with us in his redemption story.

My children are young, and there's often a point where I'll swoop in, you've messed this up enough and I'm going to do it.

But looking through the Bible, God almost always partners with humans to accomplish his works.

It's rare for God just to take control, do everything himself.

Even when Jesus himself decides to come onto earth. He doesn't just descend from heaven one day. He becomes a baby. God trusts baby Jesus into the care of Mary and Joseph.

God doesn't shy away from our humanness, he embraces it. 

At times I feel unprepared as a parent, imagine if I was trying to raise Jesus? How more unprepared I would feel. But God was comfortable with that situation.

I don't think that influences my thinking enough. But I think that speaks volumes to how committed he is to us. He's looking for partners to work with, and he wants to give us work to do.
