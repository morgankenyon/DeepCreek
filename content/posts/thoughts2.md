When I read through the Old Testament, I'm saddened by the lack of good fathers.

* Jacob shows blatant favortism with his sons.
* Eli won't step in when his sons commit evil and is judged
* Israel rejects Samuel's sons and turns to a king
* David can't/won't step in to fix his sons violating and kill family members
  * He obviously is still dealing with the fallout of his own adultery/murder issues.
* When one Godly king arrives in Judah, it seems like the next king reverts to paganism.

As a young father myself, I know it's simplistic to just wish for better fathers. Fatherhood is a journey and a struggle, it's anything but simple.

But in the midst of wealth, wisdom and blessings, why didn't God pour out fatherhood more often?

## Pastor's Kids

Today we have similar issues. The stereotype of a pastor's kid is not a healthy one.

Too often we hear stories of family neglect while the father serves his community and church.

Is there some weakness with men? That "success" in their lives blinds them from the needs of their family?

Is it the same issue? What generates "pastor's kids" today the same thing that caused me of the bible to be such lousy fathers?

Or can we just chock it up to general sin and temptation. It's one of the ways satan easily traps us, and we don't normally realize it until it's too late?

## Let's Not Focus on Them

It's easy to get lost in what people did back then.
