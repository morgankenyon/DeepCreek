summary: It's so easy to blame others for our world's problems, but what if we take responsibility for the church instead of blaming others?

When I think about our culture, one word that comes to mind is struggle.

I think Christianity really wishes our culture were different. Valued different things, elected different people.

One of the ones that manifests itself is blaming.

There's all these things to blame for why our culture is messed up.

* it's voting for people who don't share Godly values.
* Or big tech censoring our right to free speech
* Or the internet, or big media, etc.

There's so many things that we rally against, so many things that we blame for why our culture is what it is.

But what if we're the real reason?

What if blaming others is just a way to deflect responsibility? 

Ensure that I don't actually have to do anything? 

I can read my Bible, blame others and still sleep at night because it's "their fault".

I'm not suggesting those influences are promoting Godly values (they're not).

But this isn't the first time people have chosen to live selfishly. Just go read the Bible for a refresher.

This isn't the first time a culture has stopped acknowledging God.

What if they're rejecting the church more than they're rejecting Jesus? What if we get in the way of people actually experiencing God?

We're so occupied with the problems of this day, that we forget to point people to Jesus?

Christians have had political power in America for the majority of it's existence. If people didn't like that maybe it's because our culture stopped giving life to people?

On a personal level, it's so easy to get caught up in others. That we lose track of ourselves and what Jesus calls us to be. 

What if the church has the same problem. We are so caught up in our culture, that we forget to be the people of God here on earth?
