Who do you imagine Jesus is for? And who is he against?

Is he for you? For the things that you believe and care about?

When you read the bible, do you naturally feel Jesus agreeing with your viewpoints? Or do you come away humbled from how far away you find yourself from God's heart?

I think encountering a Jesus who generally agrees with you is a dangerous place to be. For several reasons:

* Jesus context is so different from our own, so I think if we find Jesus "agreeing" with us we're missreading him.
* America is the Rome of our day. And it's very likely to fall victim to the American/Roman mindset. And scripture doesn't speak well to a country when it gets to that place.

For me, it's easy to read scripture and come away unchanged. I'm "familiar" with the stories. I have a comfortable life. It's easy to hide the need I have.

But if scripture is a place of comfort for me, I don't think I really engaging with scripture. I feel like I'm importing my views onto scripture.

Scripture wasn't written for an American audience. It speaks truth into a completely different context.

It talks about farmers and sheep, lots of things I have no concept of.

It was written to an oppressed society, I live in a society that is the oppressor.

I have more in common with the Romans or the Pharisees then Jesus disciples.

I think that truth is hard for me to grasp. Hard to know how much is impacts my day to day walk with Christ.
