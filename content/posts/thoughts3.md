We Christians talk a lot about the Bible.

* We're a Bible church
* I have my quiet time and read my Bible
* I believe the God in the Bible
* etc

I've certainly said or echoed those statements. But the irony is, the Bible isn't the most approachable book for me.

The things I know about the Bible, generally have come from sermons or books that are not the Bible.

Why do I live in a culture that idolizes the Bible but also have a hard time understanding it? How common is that problem?

## What's my relationship to the Bible?

In all honesty, sometimes I read the Bible to put me to sleep.

If I'm having a hard time falling asleep, I'll read the Bible for 15 or so minutes. Sometimes that's enough to put my mind at ease and help me fall asleep.

As I write that, my first thought is that shouldn't be my relationship with the Bible. But sometimes it is.

I'll read a couple chapters of a gospel, but instead of Jesus's words lodged in my brain the rest of the day I'll just forget everything I've read.

My relationship with the Bible is complex. Sometimes I feel like my attitude and understanding of the Bible needs to radically change, but so far that hasn't happened yet.

## How do I understand the Bible?

Most of my understanding of the Bible comes from third parties.

Books that I've read, sermons or podcasts that I've listened to.

There's nothing wrong with getting information that way, but I don't know if it should be the main or only source.

I feel like one of the basic requirements of a Christian is to be able to use the Bible.

But to be honest, where does that leave the generations of Christians that couldn't even read? How did they use the Bible? How were they transformed by Jesus?

## Is the Bible the Point?

The way some Christians talk about the Bible, it's the answer to our problems.

If more people read it, understood it, we had laws based on the Bible, then our problems would be fixed, society would get better, etc.

I think that places a huge burden on people. Here's this ancient book written to vastly different culture then ours, make sure it changes your life please, preferably sooner rather than later.

That also ignores the fact that you can read scripture, have an "understanding" of it, and still not obey Christ or live like a disciple.

I don't think the Bible's the point. Learning scripture is not the goal. Being transformed and obeying Christ's commands is the goal. Is that easier with the Bible? Yes. 

But are we pushing the wrong thing. Jesus didn't die to give us more information.
