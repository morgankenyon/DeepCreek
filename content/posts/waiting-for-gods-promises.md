How long should we wait for God's promises to come true?

I'll be honest, I'm impatient. I want things to happen now, so that I can get on with my life. But God doesn't operate on my timeline.

## Abram's Wait

When God revealed himself to Abram, Abram was 75 years old. When Issac was born, Abraham was 100. 25 years between initial promise and the special son being born.

I don't think I would have waited 25 years. In that sense, I understand why Abraham/Sarah used Hagar to get a son.

Waiting sucks. No one likes to do it.

## My Hand Pain

I have some chronic hand/arm pain, it's been around 2.5 years now. To me that feels like an eternity.

So much of my life has gone by while I've struggled with this problem. I want it gone now.

But I'm just 10% of how long Abraham had to wait. What if it's 10 more years? Or 20? Can I be okay with that? What if it never gets fixed?

## More Waiting

In Genesis 15, God tells Abraham that his offspring will be oppressed for 400 years. That is lifetimes of people waiting on God's promises. I struggle to comprehend how they kept it together all those years.

If someone told me that my great-grandson's great-grandson would experience God's freedom, I'd struggle to find the good news in that.

* What about me?
* What about my life?
* Am I just peanuts, not worth much of anything?

I confess, I'm very self interested.

## Searching for Answers

When searching for answers, trying to figure out the future, trying to escape crappy conditions, the last thing I want to do is wait.

I want to take action. See change. Figure out the solution so I can get my life back on track.

But what if I should instead be waiting? Waiting for God's timing to be fulfilled? Can I be okay with that?

That's honestly the answer in front of me now, will I have the patience to wait?

Can I trust in God's timing?
