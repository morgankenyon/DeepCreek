summary: It's easy to judge the world, but I'm more like my world than different from it.

When you observe the world, it's easy to judge it.

* Politically we're as divided as ever
* We're constantly exposed to blaming and hatred for the problems of the day
* It seems like genuinely caring for people is something no one does anymore

In the church, I know there's a collective feeling that our world kind sucks. We'd rather be somewhere else. I feel that way a lot.

But to be honest, the things I condemn my society for are ever present in my life. It's a daily struggle for me.

## The Log In Your Own Eye

In Matthew, Jesus teaches about someone more concerned with splinter in their brother's eye then the beam in their own.

The comparison is comical. But that truth is reflected in my life every day.

It's so easy to point out other's sin. To keep them in the spotlight. I can choose to ignore my problems because there's are "worse".

But if we're constantly critiquing and blaming others, we never grow. We never start to work on the beam in our eyes. And so it remains there indefinitely.

## Let's Care More About the Church

Sometimes I get the impression that people think it's the churches job to remind society how messed up it is.

That is it's number 1 job, the most important thing we can do.

Yes, I think we need to take a stand against evil. But the New Testament letters doesn't spend a lot of time talking about the Roman government. How bad it is. Calling out Caesar and government officials.

Instead they're filled with the problems of the church. They wanted to get the church on a better track and spent their time and energy focused on that.

I think we need to bring that focus back. It's not about what our President does, or Congress, or Russia, but how we and our communities choose to obey God's commands wherever we find ourselves.

Our best case for Christ is by having a church that looks like him. And that happens by having people who look like him.

## The Last Day

When we approach judgement seat, Jesus is not going to ask us about our President, or your pastor, He's going to ask about you.

How did you treat people? Were you committed to following Christ? Why don't we focus on that then?
