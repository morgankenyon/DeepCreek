summary: Which kingdom do you hope in? Advocate for on a daily basis? You're either investing in Jesus's Kingdom, or one that has no hope.

1st century Palestine was a political time bomb.

On one side you have the Jews. An religious and ethnic minority with huge promises from God. Desperately waiting for the new King David to dethrone the Romans.

On the other side, an apostate empire who ruled by force. They've conquered the known world, which is obviously because their gods have smiled upon them.

Who would you give you allegiance to? Rome? The conquering empire? Or Yahweh, true God of the Israelites?

30ish years after Jesus ascended, the jews rebelled and Rome came down with the hammer.

In the midst of this political tension, Jesus came.

Which kingdom did he give his allegiance to? Which kingdom did he advocate for?

Neither. He advocated for his own Kingdom.

No worldly kingdom has much hope. Jesus's kingdom has immense hope. Jesus offers us life.

For a lot of people, the Messiah was a means to an end. Getting rid of the Romans, setting up a proper King on earth, military conquest.

But Jesus had a higher purpose, and lived that out every day.

Today we have a similar problem. Jesus, Christianity, religion is a means to an end. It's a way to get our guys elected, change culture to truly follow Jesus. You've heard the rhetoric.

But Jesus is fighting for a different battle, for a different Kingdom.

Which kingdom are you fighting for? Which kingdom do you desperately hope to win?

Are you fighting for a kingdom that has hope? Or one that will self destruct like every other one?

The world holds no promises, which is why Jesus didn't engage much with the power structures of his day. He was too busy talking about his Kingdom to care.
