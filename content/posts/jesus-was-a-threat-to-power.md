I was reading through the birth account of Jesus in Matthew, and was struck by Herod's response to Jesus being born.

The wise men visit him, asking him about the King of the Jews. He tells the wise men he also wants to worship the boy, but really wants to kill him.

When the wise men and Jesus escape, he kills all the boys around Bethlehem.

Jesus was a threat to Herod's kingship. Herod's reaction is very normal historically. A lot of kings did this.

But today I think we lose that perspective of Jesus, the Jesus who is a threat to those in power.

Jesus didn't get crucified because he was a nice guy, or because he was wise and learned. He was crucified because those with power didn't want him around.

He was a thorn in their side. Constantly exposing their lies and corruption.

Too often today, our politics is an us versus them. I'll talk about the lies and corruption of the opposition, but not anything about my own party.

But Jesus is not affiliated with any party. Jesus is neither Democrat nor Repulican. Jesus comes representing a much higher calling. He's spreading the Kingdom.

The power structures of today are interested in self preservation. They want to remain in power.

Jesus wants to change people's lives. He wants people committed to advancing his Kingdom. He's not going to rubber stamp our political agendas just because we have one or two Christian policies on them.

I'm convinced that a person who truly advances Jesus's Kingdom isn't going to win a popularity contest. Which is what our elections are. Can we get more than half the people to like you.

Truly disciples are a threat to power. That's a popular way to go about living your life.
