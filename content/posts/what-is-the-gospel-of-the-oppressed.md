I have a priviledged life.

My job, my society, my family, I've been dealt a really good hand.

And in my life, I follow Christ, trying my best to obey his commands.

But I wonder if my priviledge hides parts of the gospel from me? Parts that only reveal themselves in hardship? Oppression?

How is the gospel I encounter different than the gospel of the oppressed?

## Gospel of Priviledge

In my interactions and prayers to God, those naturally flow out of my life.

I've always had enough food, money in the bank, people I can call, etc.

I've rarely been at the end of my rope with no one to turn to.

That lifestyle affects my faith.

I've never needed God to miraculously provide food for me because that's never been a need.

## Gospel of the Oppressed

On the other hand, scores of Christians today and throughout history have desperately needed Jesus.

Where would money come from? Enemies surrounding them? Haven't eaten for a couple days.

These times of desperation lead to a different faith. One where reliance on God is required because there's nothing else.


## We Are All Desperate for God

I don't want to say that I don't need God in my priviledged life.

I desperately need him. Without Christ our lives our hopeless.

But my life hides that fact from me. It can lull me into the conclusion that I know what I'm doing. 

I can make money, go buy food, my society keeps me safe.

The need for God to do something right now rarely exists, and so I don't build the relationship that is truly dependent on him.

## Blessings of Oppression

Scripture is clear that God is near those that are persecuted.

That blessings flow from oppression. What others see as bad, we should find joy in.

That's a mindset I'm still coming to terms with. That no matter what happens, I have Christ and he is always enough.

I haven't spent a life practicing that, so that's not what comes up for me. But it's what Scripture promises us.

And it's something I'm beginning to see more of as I age. I want a relationship with God that truly relies on him. And persecution helps that happen.
