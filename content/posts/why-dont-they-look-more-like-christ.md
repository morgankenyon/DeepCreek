summary: It's easy to want people to be different. But instead of focusing on others, why not focus on you?

As a Christian, I often wonder why people can't follow God better.

Why couldn't the ancient Jewish kings simply follow the Torah?

Or why don't Christian politicians today look more like Jesus?

Or why didn't my parents do x, y or z when they raised me?

To me, they're simple questions with simple answers. 

But I can spend my time thinking about what others did/did not do without asking the important question.

Why don't I look more like Jesus?

## Turn Toward Yourself

Others are a distraction. 

It's easy to get lost in what others need to do. Or should do. And fail to ask the most important question.

What should I do.

As long as we're worried about "someone else", we'll never turn the attention towards ourselves. We'll never examine our own hearts. Begin the hard process of removing the logs from our own eyes.

God desperately wants to change our hearts, but you need to prioritize your heart in order for it to change.

## Start Small, Start at Home

God wants to change your heart. He wants to change how your family relates to each other.

He wants to change how father's interact with their kids, and how husbands treat their wives.

Give grace to your kids instead of responding in anger. Have patience for your wife when she thinks for a long time.

God wants to work in the most impactful areas of your life. A tranformed family can radiate God's life. Do you want to be that type of blessing in our world?

Or do you desire the power and control the world has to offer?

Jesus said he chooses the foolish things to shame the wise; and the weak things to shame the strong.

Start small. Start in your immediate area. It's not a glorious plan. You're not influencing the powers of this world. But you're letting the Kingdom enter your lives in a powerful way.
