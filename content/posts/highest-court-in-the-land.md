What's the highest court in the land?

Most people would answer "The Supreme Court".

That's the last place cases can be heard. The last arbitrative body.

But if you're a Christian, the answer should be your church.

> "So if you have such matters [trivial disagreements among believers], do you appoint as your judges those who have no standing in the church? I say this to your shame! Can it be that there is not one wise person among you who is able to arbitrate between fellow believers? Instead, brother goes to court against brother, and that before unbelievers." ~ 1st Corinthians 6:4-6

If Christ's wisdom is foolishness to the world, why would we appeal to it's laws?

## American Exceptionalism

Growing up American, I was constantly educated about the Constitution, the separation of government, the checks and balances, etc.

These were the things that made America different. We have rights and privileges that most people in the world can only dream of.

I'm not saying that isn't true, but I rarely heard the church effectively critique our government like Paul does.

Too often the critiques were political (my side versus your side) instead of foundational (why are you relying on this system anyway).

But which critiques feels more like 1st Corinthians 6? ("I say this to your shame!")

The world's wisdom falls flat compared to Christ, do our actions reflect that?

## Who Are You Voting For?

When Donald Trump was elected President in 2016, one of the viewpoints expressed by Christians is that he'll appoint the "right" Supreme Court Justices.

If we get the right people in office, and they make the right laws, then our nation will heal/turn back/etc.

Leadership definitely counts for something. And Paul didn't exist in a reality that Christians could be judges. (So maybe if our brother were in court, we could take stuff to them?? Fun to speculate)

But I think Paul's comments were also talking about the system. Judges are following the rules and laws of the government. Which doesn't necessarily reflect Christ's wisdom.

So why would we make them our arbiters?

## Christ's Wisdom

I'll repeat, if Christ's wisdom is foolishness to the world, why would we appeal to its laws?

I think this fact, that we claim to be Christian but advocate for the Bill of Rights or the Constitution, reflects our captivation with worldly wisdom.

Deep down inside of us, we've not fully accepted Christ and his wisdom, and the upside down value system of His Kingdom.

That's something I struggle with, something most Christians struggle with.

But if we have wisdom that the world doesn't see, then the church should be the place we find wisdom.

We should be all in on the church! Because Jesus was all in on the church! And it seems like Paul was too!
