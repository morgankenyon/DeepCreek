summary: How important are food, sleep and money to Jesus? And how important should they be to us?
---

My thoughts are consistenly consumed my thoughts of my physical needs.

Food, sleep, money, etc.

At times I use it as an excuse, "well I have to sleep, so I can't x, y or z"

Or "I need to work or I won't have any money"

But when we read the bible, specifically about Jesus, how important are these physical needs to him?

I feel like he prayed at night a lot. The night before he choose his disciples he didn't sleep at all, choosing to pray at all. It seems like prayer was more important than sleep.

When crowds of people needed food, what did he do? He just miracled a bunch of it.

When he needed money to pay the temple tax, he asked Peter to fish and get the coin from the fish.

When Mary/Martha wanted her sister to help her in the kitchen (you know, to make food), he says her sister has choosen better.

I read that and think, but if no one makes the food how are they going to eat? They have to eat right?

Maybe that's where I need to rethink how Jesus works.

What if I trust Jesus to provide those things for me instead of constantly being worried by them?

Would more miraculous things happen if I left space for Jesus to work?

Time and time again in the old testament, we see God provide for his people. Food and water in the dessert, unlimited oil in jars, bread from ravens, etc.

But I live my life as if that isn't a possibility anymore.

Is that my loss? Am I worse off because I don't trust Jesus?
